        Make sure, you set a random hash at RANDOM_HASH and NEVER change it again.
      </li>
      <li>
        The WEBSITE_MODE is very important. For security reasons never run a
        productive system with a state different than 'production'!
      </li>
      <li>
        Your system slows down with every additional plugin enabled and if addons
        are allowed.

        Try to avoid changes to THUMB_DEFAULT_X and THUMB_DEFAULT_Y after the first
        images have been uploaded. That might cause problems.

    2. Edit your website title and slogan.

    You might have to use a FTP programm (like <a href='http://cyberduck.ch/'>Cyberduck</a>)
    for that. If the folders were not created by the system, you have to create
    them manually.

    A CAPTCHA is a program that can tell whether its user is a human or a computer.
    You've probably seen them â€” colorful images with distorted text at the bottom
    of Web registration forms. CAPTCHAs are used by many websites to prevent abuse
    from "bots," or automated programs usually written to generate spam. No computer
    program can read distorted text as well as humans can, so bots cannot navigate
    sites protected by CAPTCHAs.
  </p>
  <p class='alert alert-notice'>
    CAPTCHAs can be enabled / disabled via <em>config/Candy.inc.php</em> (RECAPTCHA_ENABLED).
    Also your public and private key have to be added there (RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC & RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE).
