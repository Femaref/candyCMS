    A CAPTCHA is a program that can tell whether its user is a human or a computer. You've probably seen them â€” colorful
    images with distorted text at the bottom of Web registration forms. CAPTCHAs are used by many websites to prevent
    abuse from "bots," or automated programs usually written to generate spam. No computer program can read distorted
    text as well as humans can, so bots cannot navigate sites protected by CAPTCHAs.
